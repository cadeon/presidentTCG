Trading Card Game based on the US Presidents, and a well-known deck building game


New game idea.
“Presidential TCG"
US Presidents all have numbers, abilities, and 'actions' based on when they were in office.
Do it with modified existing trading card game rules. Like, instead of energy, it’s “funding”
Have world events as “stadium” cards.
Have technologies and other advantages as tool or item cards.
Funding could even have different types, campaign funding, taxes, military funding, all of it.

Initial health is determined by percentage of electoral college votes when each president was elected. 

"Actions" do damage to other Presidents, eventually removing them from office (they get discarded).

Gerold Ford's ability: he becomes your active President when you place him on your bench.

Truman’s ability: “If the WWII stadium card is in play, this President has two actions per turn.”

One of Nixon's actions: "Resign. Discard this President. Leave all funding for the next active President. Your opponent does not receive a prize card."

Multiple-term Presidents have versions for each term, and must progress through all terms to get to the final card.
